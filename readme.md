## I have moved to [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/beeauvin).

I've become quite disenchanted with Microsoft and GitHub and have
considered this move for quite some time. Unfortunately too many
things still require me to have an account to be functional. 
Consider any repository here to be informational, an archive, or
a mirror; such as swift packages since the Swift Package Index,
as of 2025, does not support not-github hosts.
